# ðŸ‘» Phantom V2 ðŸ‘»

## What is Phantom?
### * Phantom is an easy bypass for the extension known as Securly.
## What can it do?
### * Phantom bypasses Securly in 2 ways. 1st it lets you visit websites that are blocked by the Securly extension, and 2nd it doesn't show up on the Securly monitoring extension.
## Why did you make this?
### * Securly has terrible security, and I wanted to take advantage of that and spread awareness.
## Why open source?
### * Because this method is not that hard to maek yourself, so I wanted to share the code as it probably is not worth anything.
## How can I use this?
### * I do not want to be held responsable for what you do with this, therefore I am not providing a direct download link. All you will need to do is download this repository as a zip and run the HTML file yourself.
